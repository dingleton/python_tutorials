Files include
7_input_output.py + 2 files accessed by this code. These test the Input Output commands in section 7 of the Python tutorial https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html

name_main_1.py + _2.py & _3.py. These test for the value of __name__ when the code run as the main program or included in a module. Name_main_1.py should be run as a program which imports name_main_2.py & name_main_3.py. The latter two cam be run as (main) programs individually.
