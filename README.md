# python_tutorials

# This contains a number of python programs written to test the commands given in Python tutorials
# These were tesed with Python 3.6 running on a Windows 10 environment.
# They are published simply to show my level of competance/learning of the Python programming language
# Tutorials based on those given on the Python Website https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ and You Tube content by Corey Schafer https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5

Files include:

7_input_output.py + 2 files accessed by this code. These test the Input Output commands in chapter 7 of the online Python tutorial https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html

8_modules.py & fib_mod.py - this tests the import module function as define in chapter 8 of the online python tutorial.
It imports fib_mod.py which prints and returns the fibonnaci series of numbers.

date_time_tutorial.py, -  This experiments with various datetime function in naive and non-naive formats.

property_decorators_CS.py - This tests the Python @decorator when used with functions.

numpy_arrays.py - Code to test/experiment with the numpy moduke. 

5 Data structures.py - Code to tes/experiment with the data structures deinded in chapter 5 of the online python tutorial

name_main_1.py + _2.py & _3.py. These test for the value of __name__ when the code run as the main program or included in a module. Name_main_1.py should be run as a program which imports name_main_2.py & name_main_3.py. The latter two can be run as (main) programs individually. 

generators1_CS.py & generators2_CS.py. These define and run Python generarators alongside the equivalent code that uses functions
